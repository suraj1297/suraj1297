### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist and AI Engineer with 5 years of experience in machine learning(ML), LLMs, NLP, and algorithms. </br>
My specialty is building, training, and fine-tuning AI and ML algorithms with large sets of raw unstructured data. </br>
My skill set includes using Python, LLMs, predictive and statistical analysis to build deep learning solutions, and optimize complex data pipelines. </br>
Iâ€™ve even built a transformer architecture from the GPT research paper to understand the math underpinnings of the model.</br>

### ðŸŒ± Learning and Development
I'm a lifelong learner, and I'm always looking to improve my skills and knowledge. 
Currently, I'm working on improving my skills in Systems Designs and deepening my 
understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.

### âš¡ Fun fact
Did you know that I once built a machine learning model that could predict the flavor of potato chips with over 90% accuracy?</br>
It turns out, the key to great chip flavor is all in the seasoning!</br>
